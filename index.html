  <h1>Global Renewable Trends</h1>

  <p>The global energy transition from historical use of fossil fuel based electrical generation to renewable<br>
     generation has increased in pace over the past decade with the advancement in technology, access to capital,<br>
     and climate change affecting all life in real time. As a potential investor in future solar and wind <br>
     generation projects we want to understand/analyze global trends in electrical production by solar energy, <br>
     wind energy, and the investment in these generation capacities.</p>
